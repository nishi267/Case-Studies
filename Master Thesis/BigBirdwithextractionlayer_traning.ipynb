      "Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lymphocyte activation molecule as a receptor for peste des petits ruminants virus, a causative agent of peste des petits ruminants virus. In this study, small interfering I transfection was carried out using an adherent cell line, I95a, which was transfected with sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid conjugate. The effect of sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was assessed using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was effective in inhibiting the expression of lymphocyte activation molecule at the protein level and at the gene level. In addition, sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was also effective in inhibiting the expression of virus titres at the protein level and at the gene level. We conclude that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was effective in inhibiting the expression of lymphocyte activation molecule at the protein level and at the gene level for peste des petits ruminants virus and that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid could be used as a receptor for peste des\n",
      "Abstract The vaccination strategy of every individual is assumed to be pure, i.e. either vaccinate or not vaccinate during the vaccination campaign. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of different vaccination strategies on the prevalence of epidemics and the vaccine coverage when the vaccination compartment is introduced into the population. We find that, in spatial network, there is crossover behavior of the final vaccination level between the pure strategy case and the continuous strategy case, and very interesting, both the final vaccination level and the final epidemic size in the continuous strategy case are less than that in the pure strategy case in low cost for vaccination c. In addition, we have incorporated strategy mutation mechanism into the continuous strategy case. The macroscopic features of the vaccination dynamics as well as strategy mutation mechanism in the continuous strategy case, we have provided further insights as to how the consideration of different vaccination strategies changes the final epidemic size and the final vaccine coverage.\n",

      "Abstract The field of global health remains focused on the interface among poverty, economic disparity, and health outcomes. In the past year, economic growth has slowed throughout the developing world, with destabilized prices of natural resources. The slow economic growth threatens to impede the development of health care systems in these countries. In the last year, the field of radiology has become a focus of interest for medical students considering radiology residency, it is important for medical schools to offer means to obtain such experience so that highly qualified medical students do not avoid radiology under the misperception that radiology does not have a robust international health track.\n",
      "Abstract The methanolic extracts of chlor glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam, and aristolactam were evaluated for their antioxidant activity using on line tandem mass spectrometry coupled with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that the methanolic extracts of chlor glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam, and aristolactam exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among all the teas tested. In addition, the chlorogenic acid derivative and the caffeic acid derivatives were quantified as catechin and quercetin equivalents, respectively. The results suggest that these compounds could be partly responsible for antioxidant activity of chlor glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam, and aristolactam.\n",

      "Abstract A nurse led national telephone health helpline established in 1999 provides the opportunity to examine a new source of reported respiratory disease in the community, some of which may go unrecorded by traditional information and surveillance systems. The objective of this work was to estimate the weekly contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to the volume of respiratory calls reported to the national telephone health helpline. The 2 year period there were 49,652 laboratory reports of respiratory pathogens, 20,257 of which were about children under 5 years. The main explanatory variables were influenza and Iptococcus pneumoniae. We used regression models to estimate the weekly contribution of specific respiratory pathogens to the volume of respiratory calls reported to the national telephone health helpline. The results of this work will be used to provide detailed estimates of the burden of specific respiratory diseases reported to the national telephone health helpline to advise physicians on the timing and aetiology of respiratory calls and help interpret syndromic surveillance data used to provide early warning of community rises in respiratory infections.

      "Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the chicken hepatitis virus on the viability of brain tumor cell lines. The viability of the brain tumor cell lines was determined by flow cytometry after incubation at 37 in 5% sodium cacodylate buffer for 72 hours, and the percentage of viable cells was determined by transmission electron microscopy. The morphological features of apoptotic cells were observed by using phase contrast microscopy, fluorescent microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that untreated brain tumor cells showed no changes and exhibited intact nucleus with clear cytoplasm while after brain tumor cell lines treated with IV strain I2240 did not induce cell cycle arrest in any specific phase. In addition, the percentage of non viable brain tumor cells treated with I 50 values of IV strain I2240 was 23%, 33% and 45%, respectively. In addition, the percentage of apoptotic cells was 18.40% and 37.40% for 24 and 48 hours post inoculation, respectively. In conclusion, our results showed that the brain tumor cell lines treated with IV did not show any morphological changes and exhibited intact nucleus with clear cytoplasm.\n",
      "Abstract A prokaryotic expression system was used to produce a recombinant porcine coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine rotavirus. We found that porcine coronavirus inhibited the infection of porcine enteric coronavirus, porcine rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in intestinal epithelial cells. The antiviral activity of porcine coronavirus was through the activation of interferon signaling and the upregulation of antimicrobials and antiviral cytokines. The results demonstrated that porcine coronavirus inhibited porcine rotavirus and porcine enteric coronavirus infection in vitro. In addition, porcine coronavirus inhibited porcine rotavirus infection in vitro. In conclusion, porcine coronavirus inhibited porcine rotavirus and porcine enteric coronavirus infection in vitro through the activation of interferon signaling and the upregulation of antimicrobials and antiviral cytokines.\n",

      "Abstract The first vaccine against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 was introduced to the global market in 2006 and has been widely used since then. We previously reported that an immunodominant epitope composed of amino acid residues 169e180 is the most immunodominant among the major antigenic determinants of this virus. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody specific to the immunodominant 169e180 epitope from an antibody library and used this antibody to quantify the relative amount of 169e180 epitope in two commercially available vaccines and found that vaccine contained significantly more decoy epitope than vaccine. The antibody was then used to quantify the relative amount of 169e180 epitope in two commercially available vaccines and found that vaccine contained significantly more decoy epitope than vaccine.

      "Abstract The bat innate immune system plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of viral infections in bats. The aim of this study was to determine the sequence and antiviral activity of the bat glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene from the microbat species, Iotis davidii. The bat glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene was amplified from bat cells and sequenced. In this study, we analyzed the sequence and antiviral activity of the bat glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene. We found that the bat glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene was highly upregulated in bat cells after poly treatment or bat adenovirus infection. In addition, the bat glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene was highly upregulated in bat cells after poly treatment or bat adenovirus infection.

      "Abstract The aim of this study was to test the antiviral effect of silica against hepatitisV virus type 3. The effect of silica was tested in three different virus systems. We found that, although silica was toxic for macrophages, it additionally caused the rapid influx of new macrophage precursors into the peritoneal cavity. The protective effect of silica was not caused by direct effect on hepatitisV virus type 3 since incubation of hepatitisV virus type 3 with silica in vitro, followed by low speed, did not impair infectivity of the virus which remained in the supernatant. The protection appeared to represent a local phenomenon and not a systemic effect of silica since intravenous injection of silica was not protective against intraperitoneal infection with hepatitisV virus type 3.\n",

      "Abstract The fraction of exhaled flow that is re inhaled during normal breathing has been reported to be about 5% with tracer gas experiment on the supine thermal manikin, and about 17% with tracer gas experiment on the standing thermal manikin, but no experimental data of dynamic breathing processes has yet been performed, despite of the significant difference in the reported reinhalation ratios. In this study, we experimentally investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the re inhalation of exhaled flow during human normal breathing, both with and without the absence of thermal plumes. The results show that negligible fraction of exhaled flow is re inhaled during the inhalation process, and that the re inhaled fraction of exhaled flow is about 0.037%. The effect of the rising thermal plume seems to have mixed effect on this phenomenon in that it may also act to dilute this exhaled flow to some extent, but also convects some of it back into the inhalation zone, increasing the fraction that could be potentially re inhaled.\n",

      "Abstract The importance of psychosocial stress as a risk factor for a variety of negative health outcomes is widely recognized. We have been suggested that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression may provide an indicator of gene activation changes as a response to stress in humans, as lymphocytes have been shown to be perturbed following acute psychological stress, probably mediated through endocrine and immune markers that are activated by the stressor. In the current pilot study, we attempted to repeatedly measure gene expression patterns using a genome wide approach allowing us to examine biological pathways changes that follow an acute psychosocial laboratory stressor in adult healthy men. We found that stress induced changes in genes involved in basic cell regulatory and signaling processes, involving cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation, as well as pathways regulating adhesion molecules. In addition, stress induced changes in genes associated with the hypothalamicpituitary adrenal axis were found to be associated with changes in plasma adrenocorticotropin, cortisol, norepinephrine, and interleukin 6 concentrations. In summary, our results suggest that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression may provide an indicator of gene activation changes as a response to stress in humans, as lymphocytes have been shown to be perturbed following acute psychological stress, probably mediated through endocrine and immune markers that are activated by the stressor.\n",
      "Abstract A total of 46 bats belonging to 15 different species were captured in 8 different localities distributed in northern and central regions of the island of China. The faecal samples were collected using mist nets or hand nets, and then subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification of a fragment of the Icoronavirus gene. The identified sequence was then sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the identified sequence was closely related to betacoronavirus previously identified in greater horseshoe bat in the island of SARS, as well as other bat coronaviruses detected in other bat species worldwide. In addition, the identified sequence was also closely related to a novel bat coronavirus identified in bats of the island of SARS, and to other bat coronaviruses previously identified in other bat species worldwide.\n",
      "Abstract We aimed to assess awareness of severe acute respiratory syndrome among the general public. We conducted a cross sectional study using a self administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on demographic and socioeconomic factors, general awareness of the infection and protective measures, and knowledge of the disease epidemiology. The questionnaire was completed by 1149 respondents. The majority of the respondents were married, with only 3% above the age of 50. The majority of the respondents knew that coronavirus is the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The respondents recognized that taking antibiotics will not protect against the infection, 74% used hand sanitizers, 43% avoided crowded places, 41% avoided going to clinics and hospitals, and 11% wore masks in public places.

      "Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the role of leptospirosis in abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality in dogs and cats. In a retrospective series of cases of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality in dogs and cats submitted to the diagnostic laboratory of infectious diseases, a total of 151 samples were tested for at least one of the most common infectious agents of abortion or neonatal mortality, both bacterial and viral, including Ixoplasma burnetii and Ixoplasma gondii for dogs and Ixoplasma caninum for cats. The samples tested were negative for I. burnetii and I. burnetiiVs. The detection limit of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for I. burnetii was 10 2 dilutions. The sensitivity of the nested protocol was 100 times higher than that of a single protocol. The results showed that leptospirosis was not a common cause of abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal mortality in dogs and cats. The results suggest that leptospirosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in any case of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, especially when none of the usually suspected pathogens causing reproductive abnormalities has been identified.\n",

      "Abstract In this study, we have used web based bioinformatics tools to predict the most conserved and potential antigenic proteins of I. pneumoniae. The proteins were selected based on the presence of motifs, signal peptides, and transmembrane alpha helices, and compared to similar proteins whose localization was previously known. The results of the analysis were validated using a biological assay. The proteins were found to be surface localized with a score higher than 7.5. The proteins with no significant similarity were considered to be sufficiently distant to the human proteome and will not elicit the antibodies against the self proteins when used as vaccine candidate. In addition, two surface proteins, pavV and pullulanase, were selected. In the present study, we have exploited the web based bioinformatics tools to predict the most conserved and potential antigenic proteins of I. pneumoniae.\n",

      "Abstract The present study describes the identification and characterization of novel bovine picornaviruses from fecal samples of calves with bovine diarrhea. In the present study, 18 sequence contigs derived from five fecal samples of calves with bovine diarrhea were analyzed by deep sequencing. The 18 sequence contigs, that had a length of approximately 7500 nt, were derived from five calves with diarrhea kept on five dairy farms and exhibited similarity to nucleotide sequences of other unclassified picornavirus genomes. The nucleotide sequence homology of the five contigs to other picornavirus genomes was rather low. The predicted leader protein of bovine picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus were 59 and 61 aa long, respectively, and exhibit very low aa identities to those of other representative picornaviruses, including unclassified picornaviruses. The predicted leader protein of bovine picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus were 38.5 41.7% and 38.5 41.9% identities to those of bat picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus, respectively, suggesting that bovine picornaviruses may be classified together with the currently unclassified picornaviruses, with minor variance.\n",

      "Abstract The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus was identified as angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In this study, we tested the feasibility of blocking IVV infections by targeting its cellular receptor, metallopeptidase 2. We found that silencing of metallopeptidase 2 in the green monkey kidney cell lineV6 resulted in a modest reduction in the number of viral copies. The inhibitory effect of metallopeptidase 2 silencing was dose dependent. In addition, metallopeptidase 2 silencing was associated with a reduction in the number of viral copies in the susceptible cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that metallopeptidase 2 is a potential target for the development of antiviral agents against IV infections.\n",

      "Abstract The protein gene of six porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolates was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequences of six isolates were compared with those of reference strains. The nucleotide sequences of six isolates were 692 nucleotides containing a single open reading frame of 681 nucleotides, which encoded a 226aalong peptide. The proteins of six isolates had two potential linked glycosylation sites in theirs exposed amino terminal domain, excepting for one linked glycosylation site, which had only one linked glycosylation site because 1 nucleotide change. The phylogenetic relationship of the protein gene sequences with reference strains indicated that six isolates were different from foreign isolates and a new genotype was prevailing.\n",

      "Abstract The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a major transmembrane protein that is found in large numbers in the virion, whereas the envelope protein is a minor protein of the virion. In this study, we have used an intrinsic disorder based model to predict the mode of transmission of the spike protein. The model predicts that the spike protein is likely to play a greater role in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on the mode of transmission. The model also predicts that the spike protein is likely to play a greater role in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on the mode of transmission. The model also predicts that the spike protein is likely to play a greater role in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on the mode of transmission.

      "Abstract The ferret is a well established small animal model for the study of the infectivity, pathogenesis and transmission of both human and avian influenza viruses. In addition, the recent emergence of a number of novel zoonotic viral pathogens with the potential for causing fatal disease in human hosts has extended the biomedical significance of this species. In the current study, we describe the derivation and characterisation of a ferret specific monoclonal antibody that is well suited for studies involving infectious material. In addition, we demonstrate that this antibody can recognise a fixed antigen and is able to phenotype ferret immune cells post decontamination. The use of ferrets as a reliable model for number of pathogenic human viral infections emphasises the importance of understanding and characterising the ferret immune response.\n",

The humoral immune response is critical to protection from the virus mediated disease, and passive transfer of antibodies to mice restores immunity. The antigenic variability of the virus in humans has been extensively studied using monoclonal antibody panels, and more advanced protein engineering approaches and display technologies have been utilized to probe the human repertoire against the virus. The data from these approaches have identified important differences in the humoral response against naturalVV infection in humans compared to experimental IV infection in rodents. The differences potentially have important consequences for the design and testing of preventative vaccines that can be targeted to high risk groups such as the elderly.\n",

The effect of emodin on poly induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly activated mouse macrophages was evaluated by immunofluorescence assay. The effect of emodin on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly activated mouse macrophages was evaluated by immunofluorescence assay. We found that emodin inhibited the excess production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 in poly induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly activated mouse macrophages in a dose dependent manner. In addition, emodin significantly decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly activated mouse macrophages in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, emodin exerts the inhibitory effect on the excess production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 in poly induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 1 production in poly activated mouse macrophages in a dose dependent manner.\n",
      "Abstract The incidence of human metapneumovirus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients is estimated to be 5% 9% and up to 80% in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients, respectively. In this systematic review, we attempted to summarize all published data on human metapneumovirus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients to generate meaningful conclusions about their incidence and mortality rates, management including antiviral therapy, and prevention measures, including vaccines, in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of hVV infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients was estimated to be 5% and 0%, respectively. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients who developed hVV infections, with mortality rate of 26%. In immunocompromised patients, antiviral therapy was found to be effective in reducing the incidence of hVV infections and preventing the mortality from these infections. The use of antiviral therapy and prevention measures, including vaccines, in immunocompromised patients is still controversial. The lack of an effective drug or vaccine, infection control measures play a key role in decreasing the incidence of hVV infections, preventing nosocomial outbreaks, and subsequent morbidity and mortality in immunocom\n",
      "Abstract A growing body of evidence has implicated neuroinflammation in the development of paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate for perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways in cancer survivors with paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The analysis included demographic, clinical, and gene expression data from a cohort of cancer survivors with paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy who were followed up for 3.8 years. In addition, we evaluated for perturbations in well defined neuroinflammation related pathways using the significance and magnitude of gene gene interactions from a pathway impact analysis. We identified 53 neuroinflammation related pathways that were significantly perturbed between survivors with paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy and survivors without paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways were grouped into six categories based on their similar biological characteristics. The perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways were found between survivors with and without paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways were found between survivors with and without paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways were found between survivors with and without paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. The perturbations in neuroinflammation related pathways were found between survivors with and without paclita\n",
      "Abstract The etiology of lower respiratory tract infection is complex, and the role of cytokines in this process is not fully understood.

      "Abstract In this study, we investigated the codon usage bias in the genome of the respiratory tract associated coronavirus, a member of the family coronaviridae, and compared it with that of the respiratory tract associated coronavirus, a member of the family coronaviridae. The results show that the relative codon usage bias for the respiratory tract associated coronavirus is moderate, while that for the respiratory tract associated coronavirus is highly biased, with the highest values for the non structural protein 2 and papain like protease genes. The results suggest that the respiratory tract associated coronavirus has taken different codon evolution pathways depending on the function that each protein possesses.\n",
      "Abstract The 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease has been ongoing for more than a year. In this study, we used multiple publicly available datasets on imported cases and exported cases to estimate the early dynamics of transmission and the potential for sustained human to human transmission to occur in locations outside I. The data included daily number of new imported cases, daily number of exported cases, daily number of imported cases, daily number of exported cases, and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights. In addition, we estimated the basic reproduction number of imported and exported cases, and the probability of a new outbreak in any location. The model captured the exponential growth in case onsets in early I, the rising number of exported case onsets between I 15, and I 23, 2020 and the prevalence of infection measured on ten evacuation flights from I to seven countries. The model estimated the basic reproduction number of imported and exported cases, the probability of a new outbreak in any location, and the potential for sustained human to human transmission to occur in locations outside I. The model also estimated the potential for a sustained human to human transmission to occur in any location.

      "Abstract In recent years, sequencespecific small interfering I has been used as a powerful tool for gene function validation in high throughput screens for potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of in vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides for gene function validation in various disease models. In vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides is complicated by the need to maintain the oligonucleotides in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after systemic administration. The main goal of in vivo delivery is to have active oligonucleotides in the target cells, the stability of the oligonucleotides in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after systemic administration is the most challenging issue. In addition, the oligonucleotides need to overcome the blood vessel endothelial wall and multiple tissue barriers in order to reach the target cells. In addition, when the oligonucleotides reach the target cells, cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides and intracellular Ii activity require efficient endocytosis and intact doublestranded oligos. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of in vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides for gene function validation in various disease models. The main goal of in vivo delivery is to have active oligonucleotides in the target\n",
      "Abstract The ferret is a well established model for the study of human respiratory syncytial virus infection. In addition, it has been used as a model for the development of vaccines and anti viral therapies against influenza. In this study, we used a ferret model of human respiratory syncytial virus infection to characterize the host immune response at the early stages of the disease and to compare the response associated with lethal disease outcome or survival. In the majority of animals examined, we observed no significant changes in the host immune response at the early stages of the disease. In contrast, animals that succumbed to the disease experienced an equally severe but transient leukocyte drop, and the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was less pronounced. In contrast, the majority of animals infected with non lethal strains showed robust upregulation of the innate immune response cytokine IV at three days post infection, which was sustained through day seven. In contrast, the majority of animals infected with lethal strains showed robust upregulation of the innate immune response cytokine IV at three days post infection, which was sustained through day seven. In contrast, the majority of animals infected with non lethal strains showed robust upregulation of the innate immune response cytokine IV at three days post infection, which was sustained through day seven. In contrast, the majority of\n",
      "Abstract The influenza pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease with serious worldwide consequences. The highly pathogenic avian influenzaV5N1 strain has already infected at least 89 persons and killed 52 who had close contact with birds. The emergence of a worldwide pandemic strain poses a serious threat to public health. In this study, we found that the dyed cloth dyed with triphenylmethane dye, malachite green, and a combination of the dye and neuraminidase 2 had a synergistic antiviral effect against the influenza virus, and these findings could shed further light on applications for prophylaxis against influenza.\n",
      "Abstract The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been associated with a high case fatality rate in humans, and there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine that can provide long term protection. The aim of this study was to investigate the long term protective efficacy of a live attenuated human coronavirus vectored vesicular stomatitis virus vectored vaccine in both mice and guinea pigs. The vaccine was administered via the intranasal or oral routes, and challenged with mouse adapted human coronavirus at 6.5 or 9 months postvaccination. We found that the vaccine conferred protection in both mice and guinea pigs, with complete protection in guinea pigs at 12 months postvaccination. In contrast, no protection was observed in mice or guinea pigs at 6.5 or 9 months postvaccination. The results suggest that the vaccine is able to confer long term protection in both mice and guinea pigs.\n",
      "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and calicivirus in children seeking medical care for acute diarrhea in a rural hospital. We also attempted to find simple diagnostic methods that could be used in routine diagnostic work in developing countries. The 100 stool samples from children under 5 years of age attending the out patient department of a rural hospital were collected during the winter season from 2000 to 2001. The stool specimens were examined for rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and calicivirus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, enzyme immunoassay and electron microscopy. The results showed that rotavirus was the most frequently detected virus, followed by astrovirus, adenovirus and calicivirus. The detection rate of rotavirus and astrovirus was significantly higher than that of adenovirus and calicivirus. The detection rate of rotavirus and astrovirus was significantly higher than that of adenovirus and calicivirus. The detection rate of rotavirus and astrovirus was significantly higher than that of adenovirus and calicivirus. The detection rate of rotavirus and astrovirus was significantly higher than that of adenovirus and calicivirus.\n",
      "Abstract A series of oxadiazole based cell permeable macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3Vpro has been prepared and evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity. In vitro assays demonstrated that the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was dependent on the ring size of the oxadiazole and the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle. In vivo studies demonstrated that the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was not dependent on the ring size of the oxadiazole but was dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle. In contrast to acyclic dipeptidyl transition state inhibitors, the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was not dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker but was dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle. In contrast to acyclic dipeptidyl transition state inhibitors, the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was not dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle but was dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle.

      "Abstract A growing concern regarding poor outcomes associated with rhinovirus infection following hematopoietic cell transplantation has led to recognition of the need for antiviral agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate viral and host factors associated with prolonged shedding of rhinovirus in the upper respiratory tract in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. We conducted a prospective surveillance study of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from 2005 to 2010. The first 100 days post transplant, weekly standardized respiratory symptom surveys and viralV testing on upper respiratory samples were performed. The median duration of shedding was 9.5 days and 18 patients had prolonged shedding. The median shedding duration did not differ among species. The association between initial viral load and prolonged shedding was robust in different models. The association between initial viral load and prolonged shedding was not statistically significant after adjusting for age at transplantation or number of transplants. The study did not have a large enough sample size to analyze the effect of prolonged shedding on adverse clinical outcomes further studies are needed to clarify whether prolonged shedding significantly affects clinical outcomes.\n",
