            "Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lymphocyte activation molecule as a receptor for peste des petits ruminants virus, a causative agent of peste des petits ruminants virus. In this study, small interfering I transfection was carried out using an adherent cell line, I95a, which was transfected with sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid conjugate. The effect of sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was assessed using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was effective in inhibiting the expression of lymphocyte activation molecule at the protein level and at the gene level. In addition, sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was also effective in inhibiting the expression of virus titres at the protein level and at the gene level. We conclude that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid was effective in inhibiting the expression of lymphocyte activation molecule at the protein level and at the gene level for peste des petits ruminants virus and that sialic acid conjugated anti human sialic acid could be used as a receptor for peste des\n",
            "Abstract The vaccination strategy of every individual is assumed to be pure, i.e. either vaccinate or not vaccinate during the vaccination campaign. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of different vaccination strategies on the prevalence of epidemics and the vaccine coverage when the vaccination compartment is introduced into the population. We find that, in spatial network, there is crossover behavior of the final vaccination level between the pure strategy case and the continuous strategy case, and very interesting, both the final vaccination level and the final epidemic size in the continuous strategy case are less than that in the pure strategy case in low cost for vaccination c. In addition, we have incorporated strategy mutation mechanism into the continuous strategy case. The macroscopic features of the vaccination dynamics as well as strategy mutation mechanism in the continuous strategy case, we have provided further insights as to how the consideration of different vaccination strategies changes the final epidemic size and the final vaccine coverage.\n",

            "Abstract The aim of this study was to test the antiviral effect of silica against hepatitisV virus type 3. The effect of silica was tested in three different virus systems. We found that, although silica was toxic for macrophages, it additionally caused the rapid influx of new macrophage precursors into the peritoneal cavity. The protective effect of silica was not caused by direct effect on hepatitisV virus type 3 since incubation of hepatitisV virus type 3 with silica in vitro, followed by low speed, did not impair infectivity of the virus which remained in the supernatant. The protection appeared to represent a local phenomenon and not a systemic effect of silica since intravenous injection of silica was not protective against intraperitoneal infection with hepatitisV virus type 3.\n",

            "Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the availability of videos related to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak on popular video sharing websites. The first week of the outbreak, a total of 150 videos were screened for content related to the 2019 novel coronavirus. The videos were classified as useful if they contained scientifically correct information about any aspect of the disease and if they did not mention areas of uncertainty or additional sources of patient information. The total duration of all videos attracted a cumulative number of 21,288,856 views and 259108 likes. The kappa coefficient of agreement regarding the usefulness of the videos was 0.72. The mean number of days since video upload was 6 in our study compared to 61 days during previous disease outbreaks. The most popular videos were those related to transmission and clinical symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. The videos were shared by academic institutions and hospitals in SARS which contributed to a slightly higher percentage of misleading videos. The misleading videos were more popular than useful videos as evidenced by a higher mean number of views and likes. The current outbreak evolves, international health agencies and academic institutions should release more videos with information about screening and testing of this disease.\n",
            "Abstract The carbohydrate composition and the immunoreactivity of the and glycoproteins of the coronavirusV were studied at different stages of their maturation. The biosynthesis of and was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The glycosylation of and was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. We found that among the four major antigenic sites previously defined, only site was notably expressed by the unglycosylated polypeptide 155V, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon ore g glycoycosylation, three of the four antibs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated polypeptide 26V. The data led us to conclude that co translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of IV glycoproteins.\n",

The performance characteristics of this platform versus conventional virologic procedures were evaluated in a hospital based pilot study over one season of respiratory infections. In total, 500 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were tested by a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction platform and conventional virologic procedures. The performance characteristics of the platform versus conventional virologic procedures were evaluated in a hospital based pilot study over one season of respiratory infections. In total, 192 patients were recruited, and 188 evaluable results were evaluable for the primary analysis. The performance characteristics of the platform versus conventional virology were 89.1% and 80.3% for the primary analysis, and 89.1% and 80.3% for the secondary analysis, respectively. The performance characteristics of the platform versus conventional virology were not significantly different between adult and paediatric patients. We conclude that the multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction platform could detect most viruses identified by conventional virology methods rapidly and accurately, and allowed identification of mixed pathogens in clinical specimens.\n",
            "Abstract The fraction of exhaled flow that is re inhaled during normal breathing has been reported to be about 5% with tracer gas experiment on the supine thermal manikin, and about 17% with tracer gas experiment on the standing thermal manikin, but no experimental data of dynamic breathing processes has yet been performed, despite of the significant difference in the reported reinhalation ratios. In this study, we experimentally investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the re inhalation of exhaled flow during human normal breathing, both with and without the absence of thermal plumes. The results show that negligible fraction of exhaled flow is re inhaled during the inhalation process, and that the re inhaled fraction of exhaled flow is about 0.037%. The effect of the rising thermal plume seems to have mixed effect on this phenomenon in that it may also act to dilute this exhaled flow to some extent, but also convects some of it back into the inhalation zone, increasing the fraction that could be potentially re inhaled.\n",

            "Abstract The importance of psychosocial stress as a risk factor for a variety of negative health outcomes is widely recognized. We have been suggested that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression may provide an indicator of gene activation changes as a response to stress in humans, as lymphocytes have been shown to be perturbed following acute psychological stress, probably mediated through endocrine and immune markers that are activated by the stressor. In the current pilot study, we attempted to repeatedly measure gene expression patterns using a genome wide approach allowing us to examine biological pathways changes that follow an acute psychosocial laboratory stressor in adult healthy men. We found that stress induced changes in genes involved in basic cell regulatory and signaling processes, involving cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation, as well as pathways regulating adhesion molecules. In addition, stress induced changes in genes associated with the hypothalamicpituitary adrenal axis were found to be associated with changes in plasma adrenocorticotropin, cortisol, norepinephrine, and interleukin 6 concentrations. In summary, our results suggest that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression may provide an indicator of gene activation changes as a response to stress in humans, as lymphocytes have been shown to be perturbed following acute psychological stress, probably mediated through endocrine and immune markers that are activated by the stressor.\n",

In a retrospective series of cases of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality in dogs and cats submitted to the diagnostic laboratory of infectious diseases, a total of 151 samples were tested for at least one of the most common infectious agents of abortion or neonatal mortality, both bacterial and viral, including Ixoplasma burnetii and Ixoplasma gondii for dogs and Ixoplasma caninum for cats. The samples tested were negative for I. burnetii and I. burnetiiVs. The detection limit of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for I. burnetii was 10 2 dilutions. The sensitivity of the nested protocol was 100 times higher than that of a single protocol. The results showed that leptospirosis was not a common cause of abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal mortality in dogs and cats. The results suggest that leptospirosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in any case of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, especially when none of the usually suspected pathogens causing reproductive abnormalities has been identified.\n",

The proteins were selected based on the presence of motifs, signal peptides, and transmembrane alpha helices, and compared to similar proteins whose localization was previously known. The results of the analysis were validated using a biological assay. The proteins were found to be surface localized with a score higher than 7.5. The proteins with no significant similarity were considered to be sufficiently distant to the human proteome and will not elicit the antibodies against the self proteins when used as vaccine candidate. In addition, two surface proteins, pavV and pullulanase, were selected. In the present study, we have exploited the web based bioinformatics tools to predict the most conserved and potential antigenic proteins of I. pneumoniae.\n",

The total number of cases was 241, and the morbidity and case fatality rate were,000 and 11.2%, respectively. The most common clinical features were fever, malaise, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia. The most common laboratory manifestations were haematuria and proteinuria, suggesting a rapid progression to multiple organ failure. In addition, the cytopathic effects of the virus were modest in I cells, rendering detection problematic. In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome were similar to those of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, suggesting that the clinical symptoms of laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome were similar to those of human granulocytic anaplasmosis.\n",
            "Abstract In the past 50 years, several human coronaviruses have been identified. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003 changed the landscape of coronavirus studies entirely and marked the new era of combating infectious diseases. In this review, we focus on the host innate antiviral response to coronavirus infection and the viral strategies adopted by these viruses to subvert innate immunity.\n",

            "Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible interaction between porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, which causes respiratory disease in swine, and the respiratory pathogen, porcine metapneumovirus, which causes secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia in swine. The animals were randomly allocated to four groups of four pigs each and housed in four different isolation rooms. The animals were inoculated intranasally with porcine metapneumovirus, followed by intranasal challenge with a mixture of equal parts of two strains of porcine metapneumovirus and a mixture of two strains of porcine respiratory syncytial virus. The animals were euthanized and necropsy was then performed. The results showed that all animals inoculated intranasally with porcine metapneumovirus caused macroscopic pulmonary consolidation, whereas all animals inoculated intranasally with porcine metapneumovirus alone caused only mild lesions. In contrast, all animals inoculated intranasally with porcine metapneumovirus were inoculated intranasally with a mixture of two strains of porcine respiratory syncytial virus, followed by intranasal challenge with a mixture of two strains of porcine metapneumovirus and a mixture of two strains of porcine respiratory syncy\n",
            "Abstract The present study describes the identification and characterization of novel bovine picornaviruses from fecal samples of calves with bovine diarrhea. In the present study, 18 sequence contigs derived from five fecal samples of calves with bovine diarrhea were analyzed by deep sequencing. The 18 sequence contigs, that had a length of approximately 7500 nt, were derived from five calves with diarrhea kept on five dairy farms and exhibited similarity to nucleotide sequences of other unclassified picornavirus genomes. The nucleotide sequence homology of the five contigs to other picornavirus genomes was rather low. The predicted leader protein of bovine picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus were 59 and 61 aa long, respectively, and exhibit very low aa identities to those of other representative picornaviruses, including unclassified picornaviruses. The predicted leader protein of bovine picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus were 38.5 41.7% and 38.5 41.9% identities to those of bat picornavirus group 3 and canine picornavirus, respectively, suggesting that bovine picornaviruses may be classified together with the currently unclassified picornaviruses, with minor variance.\n",

In the present work, continuous and discontinuous epitopes have been extracted from a collection of natural peptides, identified by positive cell assays involving known antibody isotypes. In order to evaluate the average level of exposure for a given epitope, a generic approach has been applied to a set of diverse antigens for which epitopes have been experimentally identified and collected from a database of known antibody isotypes. We have also compared distributions on the surface of individual epitopes considering the epitope type and the calculation mode.\n",
            "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of trichomonads in the feces of puppies and to evaluate the risk factors for infection by trichomonas hominis and the influence of the parasite on feces consistency. The prevalence of trichomonads was determined by culturing of fecal samples from 215 puppies representing 25 different breeding kennels. The prevalence of trichomonads was 15.8% and 20%, respectively. The prevalence of trichomonads was significantly higher in large breeding kennels than in small breeding kennels. The risk factors for infection by trichomonads were high excreting levels of canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus oocysts. In multivariate analysis, high excreting levels of parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus were significantly associated with an abnormal fecal score, whereas high excreting levels of parvovirus type 2 and canine parvovirus oocysts were significantly associated with an abnormal fecal score. In conclusion, the prevalence of trichomonads in the feces of puppies was 15.8% and 20%, respectively, and the risk factors for infection by trichomonads were high excreting levels of parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus oocysts.\n",

            "Abstract The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus was identified as angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In this study, we tested the feasibility of blocking IVV infections by targeting its cellular receptor, metallopeptidase 2. We found that silencing of metallopeptidase 2 in the green monkey kidney cell lineV6 resulted in a modest reduction in the number of viral copies. The inhibitory effect of metallopeptidase 2 silencing was dose dependent. In addition, metallopeptidase 2 silencing was associated with a reduction in the number of viral copies in the susceptible cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that metallopeptidase 2 is a potential target for the development of antiviral agents against IV infections.\n",

In addition, the recent emergence of a number of novel zoonotic viral pathogens with the potential for causing fatal disease in human hosts has extended the biomedical significance of this species. In the current study, we describe the derivation and characterisation of a ferret specific monoclonal antibody that is well suited for studies involving infectious material. In addition, we demonstrate that this antibody can recognise a fixed antigen and is able to phenotype ferret immune cells post decontamination. The use of ferrets as a reliable model for number of pathogenic human viral infections emphasises the importance of understanding and characterising the ferret immune response.\n",

            "Abstract The memory phenomenon is attributed to pre existing neutralizing antibodies and activated cells. In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. The structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein of ainderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of other morbilliviruses. The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the antigen is formed in I 2, which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier.\n",

The humoral immune response is critical to protection from the virus mediated disease, and passive transfer of antibodies to mice restores immunity. The antigenic variability of the virus in humans has been extensively studied using monoclonal antibody panels, and more advanced protein engineering approaches and display technologies have been utilized to probe the human repertoire against the virus. The data from these approaches have identified important differences in the humoral response against naturalVV infection in humans compared to experimental IV infection in rodents. The differences potentially have important consequences for the design and testing of preventative vaccines that can be targeted to high risk groups such as the elderly.\n",

In this systematic review, we attempted to summarize all published data on human metapneumovirus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients to generate meaningful conclusions about their incidence and mortality rates, management including antiviral therapy, and prevention measures, including vaccines, in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of hVV infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and hematologic malignancy patients was estimated to be 5% and 0%, respectively. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients who developed hVV infections, with mortality rate of 26%. In immunocompromised patients, antiviral therapy was found to be effective in reducing the incidence of hVV infections and preventing the mortality from these infections. The use of antiviral therapy and prevention measures, including vaccines, in immunocompromised patients is still controversial.

In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of in vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides for gene function validation in various disease models. In vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides is complicated by the need to maintain the oligonucleotides in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after systemic administration. The main goal of in vivo delivery is to have active oligonucleotides in the target cells, the stability of the oligonucleotides in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after systemic administration is the most challenging issue. In addition, the oligonucleotides need to overcome the blood vessel endothelial wall and multiple tissue barriers in order to reach the target cells. In addition, when the oligonucleotides reach the target cells, cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides and intracellular Ii activity require efficient endocytosis and intact doublestranded oligos. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of in vivo delivery of sequencespecific I oligonucleotides for gene function validation in various disease models.

            "Abstract The ferret is a well established model for the study of human respiratory syncytial virus infection. In addition, it has been used as a model for the development of vaccines and anti viral therapies against influenza. In this study, we used a ferret model of human respiratory syncytial virus infection to characterize the host immune response at the early stages of the disease and to compare the response associated with lethal disease outcome or survival. In the majority of animals examined, we observed no significant changes in the host immune response at the early stages of the disease. In contrast, animals that succumbed to the disease experienced an equally severe but transient leukocyte drop, and the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was less pronounced. In contrast, the majority of animals infected with non lethal strains showed robust upregulation of the innate immune response cytokine IV at three days post infection, which was sustained through day seven. In contrast, the majority of animals infected with lethal strains showed robust upregulation of the innate immune response cytokine IV at three days post infection, which was sustained through day seven.

            "Abstract A series of oxadiazole based cell permeable macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3Vpro has been prepared and evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity. In vitro assays demonstrated that the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was dependent on the ring size of the oxadiazole and the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle. In vivo studies demonstrated that the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was not dependent on the ring size of the oxadiazole but was dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle. In contrast to acyclic dipeptidyl transition state inhibitors, the inhibition of norovirus 3Vpro activity was not dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker but was dependent on the position of the oxadiazole linker in the macrocycle.

            "Abstract The quest for clean serum specimens to detect immunological responses to the presence of important pathogens has characterised the history of disease testing in veterinary medicine. In recent years, the availability of good laboratory services and practices has improved diagnostic efficiency and decreased turnaround times, making it practical to transport suitable specimens to well equipped diagnostic laboratories. The use of animal body fluids, secretions and tissues can also be useful for disease diagnosis and control.\n",

            "Abstract A growing concern regarding poor outcomes associated with rhinovirus infection following hematopoietic cell transplantation has led to recognition of the need for antiviral agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate viral and host factors associated with prolonged shedding of rhinovirus in the upper respiratory tract in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. We conducted a prospective surveillance study of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from 2005 to 2010. The first 100 days post transplant, weekly standardized respiratory symptom surveys and viralV testing on upper respiratory samples were performed. The median duration of shedding was 9.5 days and 18 patients had prolonged shedding. The median shedding duration did not differ among species. The association between initial viral load and prolonged shedding was robust in different models. The association between initial viral load and prolonged shedding was not statistically significant after adjusting for age at transplantation or number of transplants. The study did not have a large enough sample size to analyze the effect of prolonged shedding on adverse clinical outcomes further studies are needed to clarify whether prolonged shedding significantly affects clinical outcomes.\n",

In addition, we have incorporated strategy mutation mechanism into the continuous strategy case. The macroscopic features of the vaccination dynamics as well as strategy mutation mechanism in the continuous strategy case, we have provided further insights as to how the consideration of different vaccination strategies changes the final epidemic size and the final vaccine coverage.\n",
            "Abstract We have previously shown that intranasal instillation of the neurotropic neurotropic virus I41 results in a marked depletion of serotonin in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex with no substantial effects oll dopamine, noradrenaline, choline acetyltranst erase and glutamate decarboxylase. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of amphetamine treatment on the spread of the virus in the brain and on the motor activity of infected rats. The results showed that the amphetamine treated rats had significantly lower locomotor scores than the uninfected amphetamine treated rats at the 50, 60, 70 and 90 min time periods, whereas the locomotor scores of the uninfected amphetamine treated rats were significantly higher than those of the uninfected amphetamine treated rats at the 50, 60, 70 and 90 min time periods. The results of the present study illustrate that selectivity in virus attack on groups of neurons projecting within the olfactory system can be obtained. The mutants may, therefore, have potential as valuable tools in combined neurochemical and behaviour studies aimed at evaluating the neuroanatomical correlates of behaviour.\n",

            "Abstract The antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts of the leaves of Iouttuynia cordata was determined using on line tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the methanolic extracts of I. cordata had the highest activity among all the teas tested. The major active compounds were chlor glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam, and aristolactam. In addition, catechin and quercetin hexoside were quantified as chlorogenic acid equivalents and also procyanidin and quercetin hexoside were quantified as catechin and quercetin equivalents, respectively. The results suggest that these compounds could be partly responsible for antioxidant activity of I. cordata tea.\n",

            "Abstract The antiviral effect of silica against hepatitis virus type 3 was tested in three different virus systems. The antiviral effect of silica was not caused by direct effect on hepatitis virus type 3 since incubation of hepatitis virus type 3 with silica in vitro, followed by low speed, did not impair infectivity of the virus which remained in the supernatant. The protective effect of silica was not due to systemic effects of silica since intravenous injection of silica was not protective against intraperitoneal infection with hepatitis virus type 3. The protection appeared to represent a local phenomenon and not a systemic effect of silica since intravenous injection of silica was not protective against intraperitoneal infection with hepatitis virus type 3. The data may be in contrast to the conclusion that the protective effect of silica is caused by killing of the target cells for replication of hepatitis virus type 3.\n",

            "Abstract A nucleic acid amplification test based on real time reverse transcriptaseV is currently available that, although highly sensitive, they are more expensive and require a longer turnaround time than influenza antigen detection tests. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with their 95% confidence intervals of all methods, and to semi quantify the viral load by the measure of the real time reverse transcriptase PCR. The retrospective study was conducted on 70 specimens from patients with acute respiratory tract infection during the 2013 2014 period. In thawed samples, real time reverse transcriptaseV was positive to influenza viruses in 46 and negative in 3 out of the 49 previously positives. The specificity and kappa coefficient of agreement of all methods were 100%. The turnaround time of real time reverse transcriptaseV was 13, 15 and 75 min, respectively. This study demonstrated 100% specificity in contrast to those reported by other investigators who found false positives or influenza typing errors. The results suggest that real time reverse transcriptaseV may be an optimal alternative to influenza antigen detection tests as a point of care method for influenza detection in clinical emergency settings.\n",

We conducted a cross sectional study of 477 homeless men living in two shelters of SARS over the 2015e2017 period. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs was higher in individuals 50 years of age, suffering from chronic respiratory diseases and in individuals born in SARS but suffering from chronic respiratory diseases. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs was significantly higher in those visiting their country of origin for migrants. The symptom and sign prevalence was significantly higher in those carrying at least one virus. We identified chronic homelessness, chronic respiratory diseases and visiting their countries of origin for migrants as independent risk factors for respiratory symptoms and signs. The results of our study emphasize the difference between the microbial communities of the nose and throat, indicating the need for both nasal and pharyngeal swab sampling in future studies to better assess upper respiratory microbiological carriage.\n",

In this paper, we have developed an algorithm for task allocation in a distributed system using the data and alerts which were issued by the cdc.gov, who.int 10, cdc.gov 11 during the epidemics. The algorithm is designed so as to find out the factors contributing to the rise of disease and further exploiting these factors to get better efficiency from the system. The algorithm is developed mainly keeping the functional properties of SARSv virus along with some properties and behavioral aspects of common people. The parameter transmission rate and spread ratio are used in the model to understand the significance of these properties on the emergence of the pandemics. The different phases of the disease are taken into consideration, for instance the patient in latent phase cannot spread the disease, but the immunity of the patient might increase or decrease. The number of people getting infected or dying of the disease were interpreted as task completed, while the people not getting affected were represented as incompetence of the algorithm. This model was designed so as to find out the factors contributing to the rise of disease and further exploiting these factors to get better efficiency from the system.\n",

            "Abstract The fraction of the exhaled airflow that is re inhaled during normal breathing has been reported to be about 5% by tracer gas experiment on the supine thermal manikin, and about 17% by tracer gas experiment on the standing thermal manikin, but no experimental data of dynamic breathing processes has yet been performed, despite of the significant difference in the reported reinhalation ratios. The present study aims to experimentally investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the re inhalation of exhaled flow during human normal breathing, both with and without the absence of thermal plumes. The results show that a negligible fraction of exhaled flow is re inhaled during the inhalation process, and that the re inhalation ratio is about 0.037%. The effect of the rising thermal plume seems to have mixed effect on this phenomenon in that it may also act to dilute this exhaled air to some extent, but also convects some of it back into the inhalation zone, increasing the fraction that could be potentially re inhaled.\n",

            "Abstract In vitro studies have contributed significantly toward understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus on a molecular level. The intestinal mucosa consists of a diversity of specialized cell types in different states of differentiation. In vitro studies with cell lines, mainly derived from colon, have contributed significantly toward understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus on a molecular level. The intestinal mucosa consists of mature enterocytes near the top of the villi, which are the primary target cells for virus replication. In these cells provoke numerous intraand extracellular pathological changes that inevitably lead to disruption of the absorptive and digestive functions of the small intestine, and consequently, to malabsorption and diarrhea. In these cells, the rise in cyt is believed to be independent of SARS modulation, and this rise perturbs cytoskeleton and tight junction integrity, which ultimately leads to cell lysis. In vitro studies with cell lines, mainly derived from colon, have contributed significantly toward understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus on a molecular level. The intestinal mucosa consists of a diversity of specialized cell types in different states of differentiation. The biological significance of elevated or reduced expression of these genes for rotavirus pathogenesis is discussed.\n",

We collected 88 faecal samples from healthy cats and 11 ascitic fluid samples from cats with clinical signs of wet form of feline infectious peritonitis. The samples fell into the typical feline coronavirus genotype. The sequences of the 3 0 end of the non structural canine coronavirus 3 gene were amplified and sequenced. The sequences clustered into two main clades. The first clade included the typical feline coronavirus genotype whereas the second clade is divided into two separate clusters comprising atypical feline coronavirus and atypical feline coronavirus. The sequences of the 3 0 end of the non structural canine coronavirus 3 gene from strains 9, 22, 29, 30, 163 and dog 1 shared the highest sequence identity with prototype or field strains, ranging from 89 to 97.9% and less than 86.2% with prototype feline coronavirus strains, respectively.

            "Abstract In the context of allergic response, the identification of critical amino acids for antibody binding may be useful in the development of immunotherapy strategies by modifying cell epitopes to prevent antibody binding while preserving cell epitopes. In the present work, continuous and discontinuous epitope sequences from natural peptides, identified by positive cell assays involving known antibody isotypes, have been extracted from the IVV 2.0 site along with their associated identifiers. In order to evaluate the average level of exposure for a given epitope, a generic approach has been applied to a set of diverse antigens for which epitopes have been experimentally identified and collected from the IVV database.

            "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of trichomonads infecting puppies living in veterinary breeding kennels, to confirm the predominance of trichomonas hominis in dogs, to investigate the genetic diversity of a. hominis isolates identified in the canine population and to evaluate the risk factors for infection by a. hominis and the influence of the parasite on feces consistency. The prevalence of trichomonads was determined by culturing of fecal samples from 215 puppies representing 25 veterinary breeding kennels. The samples were examined for 6 gastrointestinal pathogens parvovirus type 2, coronavirus, Ixocara canis, SARSoisospora ohioensis complex, and Iardia intestinalis. The samples were also tested for the presence of motile trichomonads by microscopy after culturing. The overall prevalence of trichomonads was 15.8% among puppies and 20% among breeding kennels. The prevalence of trichomonads was associated with a high excreting high level of I. canis oocysts and a high fecal score. The risk factors for infection by a. hominis were identified by multivariate analysis. The pathogenic potential of a. hominis remained uncertain and has to be further evaluated by experimental infection studies\n",
            "Abstract The midpoint rooting method is a simple and reliable way to place the root of the tree at the midpoint between two most divergent operational taxonomic units, as measured by the sum of branch lengths between them. In the present study, we assumed that the outgroup method yields the correct root position in every tree. The assumption may be doubtful in some cases, yet testing the choice of outgroup by systematists is clearly beyond the scope of our study. We proceeded to the empirical test of the outgroup method, which required the assignment of an outgroup root. In this test, 28 out of 50 analysed data sets provided multiple outgroups. The empirical test of the outgroup method, which required the assignment of an outgroup root, showed that the outgroup method yielded the correct root position in all 50 analysed data sets. The 50% cut off trees analysis, which required the assignment of an outgroup root, showed the highest success rate of the outgroup method, increasing from 35 to 39 out of 50 data sets.

            "Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the seroprevalence of bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in dairy cows managed under organic and conventional management systems and to investigate potential risk factors associated with these infections. This study included 40 dairy herds free of bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus, which were visited on two occasions between 7 days before their predicted calving date and 42 days after calving. The samples were tested for antibodies to bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus using indirect agglutination inhibition assays. The mean prevalence of cows positive to both viruses was 85% in 2005 and 89% in 2006 for the cows in conventional herds, and 54% in 2005 and 59% in 2006 for the cows in the organic herds. In two organic herds all sampled animals were seronegative to bovine coronavirus. In five of the organic herds, only cows in their fourth or later lactation were seropositive to bovine coronavirus, suggesting that such herds can remain free from this infection for several years. The finding of significantly lower seroprevalence to bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in 1 3 year old animals relative to animals in the 3 5 year old category indicates an age dependent seroprevalence to these viruses.\n",
            "Abstract In order to test the feasibility of blocking severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus infections by targeting its cellular receptor, metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2, two stable cell lines were used. The green monkey kidney cell lineVV6 showed good susceptibility to IVV. The inoculation dose of 1 10 3V, the velocity of viral amplification also decreased. The inoculation dose was further decreased to 10 3V, the virus did not replicate in the other cell line. In order to quantify the amount of metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a 63 nucleotide amplicon was used to amplify an amplicon of 63 nucleotides. The amplicon was visualized by ethidium bromide staining after separating by 2 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. The relative copy numbers of metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 could be detected in all of the susceptible cell lines and its abundance correlated with IVV susceptibility. The blocking effects of metallopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 silencing appeared to be modest. The hypothesis that eliminating metallopeptidase angiotensin converting\n",

            "Abstract The frequency in which respiratory virus infections have been identified in association with acute worsening of respiratory function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has varied in different studies. In order to extend our understanding of the prevalence of respiratory viral infection in acute respiratory illnesses in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we used SARSV assays to evaluate samples from the previous two prospective studies for evidence of respiratory virus infection. In 96 study subjects with 194 separate illnesses for which samples were available for analysis, picornaviruses were the most common respiratory virus infections identified and the most frequent virus group identified only by SARSV. In 81 illnesses in which dual respiratory infections were identified, there were seven illnesses in which dual respiratory infections were identified. The application of IV assays to clinical specimens collected from patients with acute respiratory illness significantly increased the number of illnesses in which an associated respiratory viral infection was identified.\n",

The child had been hospitalized at the age of 1 year due to rhinitis, airflow obstruction and acute wheezing. We were treated with corticosteroids and inhalative bronchodilatators to control bronchoconstriction. The following year, he frequently suffered from respiratory tract infections associated with bronchoconstriction. The examination revealed a weakened general condition, body temperature of 38 A, tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, subcostal retractions, wheezing and left apical fine rales upon lung auscultation. The nasopharyngeal swab was tested by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for human metapneumovirus. In the one month after he was discharged from the hospital, the specimen drawn from the child one month after he was discharged from the hospital was negative for human metapneumovirus by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The detection of human metapneumovirus in the nasopharyngeal swab in a child with a clinical picture of pneumonia supports the assumption that this virus has a causative role in respiratory diseases.\n",

We achieved a state of the art performance for disambiguation, the performance of our toponym detection was mediocre. The problem of toponym detection as a sequence labeling task, and via the use of annotated data and the extraction of several useful features, we achieve significant improvements over our past work, with a score of 0.81 for the toponym class. We additionally explore the use of distant supervision, a particular learning framework where only a finite set of positive examples are known and an important quantity of unlabeled examples are available. In addition, by improving geographic metadata linked to popular sequence databases, we will enrich other sciences beyond phylogeography that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.\n",

The optimal incubation time for the assay was set at 15 min. The results were inspected directly with the naked eyes within 5 min. The sensitivity of the assay was 9.4 10 1 copies per reaction. The specificity of the assay was 100% for detection of three genotypes of canine distemper virus. The assay was tolerant to 5 9 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay. In conclusion, the visible, incubation instrument free reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid detection of canine distemper virus showed distinct advantages in terms of detection time and equipment requirements.\n",
            "Abstract In this investigation, a plant virus microarray was developed for the detection of plant viruses at the genus level. In order to design a minimal number of probes to detect plant viruses at the genus level, a probe design protocol was developed. In total, 148,537 viral genome sequences and 57,512 plant sequences were used to identify off target hybridizations. In this investigation, three 70mer probes were designed for the genus level microarray. The average number of probes per virus was 11.43. The sensitivity of the microarray was evaluated using a total of 169 plant viruses. The microarray detected the largest number of plant virus genera reported so far. We also aimed to use a minimal number of probes, thus minimizing the cost and probe redundancy of the microarray. The results suggest that the detection microarray system does not need prior knowledge of newly emerged viruses, thus it will not be limited by selection of specific primer sequences or antibodies.\n",

            "Abstract The relationship between sponges and medicines goes back to the 18th century, and physicians have used freshwater sponges for the treatment of patients. The discovery of nucleosides spongothymidine and spongouridine in the marine sponge Itethia crypta, 1951, led to the development of an extensive collection of compounds that can be useful to treat human diseases. In addition to spongothymidine and spongouridine, numerous anticancer molecules with different mode of action have been discovered in marine sponges. We have surveyed the discoveries of products derived from marine sponges up to now, and attempted to show the variety of potential medical applications of metabolites from sponges and the mechanisms by which they interfere with the pathogenesis of human diseases. The following sections summarize compounds by disease type and describe their mode of action, and discuss the reasons why sponges would produce these metabolites.\n",

            "Abstract The human interferon gene contains two single nucleotide polymorphisms, located in the promoter region at positions 123 and 88, that affect its expression level. The flowering of such studies highlights the crucial medical importance of these variants as biomarkers of susceptibility or resistance to viral infections in humans. The aim of this study was to contribute to this inventory and to examine whether genotype frequencies vary among ethnic groups. In this study, a total of 197 individuals from three distinct populations were tested for the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human interferon gene. The results show that the frequencies of the two non synonymous polymorphisms in the coding sequence are significantly different among the three populations, the allele being dominant in one population and the allele elsewhere. In the case of the 123 and 88 polymorphisms, the allele distributions about the same throughout the three populations were the allele distributions about the same throughout the three populations. In the case of the 123 and 88 polymorphisms, the allele distributions about the same throughout the three populations were the allele distributions about the same throughout the three populations.

            "Abstract A large number of people have different ethnicities, underlying clinical conditions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The overcrowding is ideal for the spread of respiratory viruses and is a major public health concern. In addition to these, newly emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus, IV respiratory syndrome related coronavirus, and influenza viruses of swine and avian origin are threat to public health. The epidemiology, evolution, and circulation patterns of respiratory viruses in SARSV may be affected by two major factors. The presence of over 11.9 million foreign workers from more than 100 countries may help to introduce new viral strains. In addition, overcrowding is ideal for the spread of respiratory viruses and is a major public health concern.

            "Abstract We investigated the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity with susceptibility to and severity of self reported symptoms in acute I. burnetii infection in two populations. The first population consisted of 85 acute fever cases and the second population consisted of 1,008 community controls. The symptom score was calculated as the sum of all reported symptoms. The association of the determined polymorphisms with the symptom score was assessed by using cross tabulations and I square tests. We found a statistically significant association between the determined polymorphisms and the symptom score in population 1. In population 2, no significant association was observed between the determined polymorphisms and the symptom score. The symptom score appeared to be much higher in population 2 compared to population 1, based on symptom scores and hospital admission rates. The symptom severity in population 2 could possibly be explained by a higher environmental exposure dose, as reflected by the large numbers of abortions in goats in the 2009 outbreak and extremely high attack rates in farm contacts.\n",

            "Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus encoded protein 8a has a single open reading frame which has been proposed not only to enhance viral replication but also to induce apoptosis through mitochondria dependent pathway. The topology and biological function remains yet unknown. In this study, a set of computational bundle models of 8a is generated. The set of different oligomeric bundle models from 4 to 6 units is generated. The computational bundle models suggest that the secondary structure of protein is generated prior to its tertiary or quaternary structure. The putative water filled pentameric bundle of 8a should be made of helices positioned in an approximately 11 distance in respect to their helical long axis and with a tilt of about 40. The tilt shows rather large fluctuations and mismatch is compensated by an alternating kink angle.\n",
            "Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus encodes a transmembrane protein, which has three transmembrane domains on the terminal side, and a long cytoplasmic domain on the terminal side. In the present study, a structural model has been proposed for the full monomeric unit of the 3a protein, based on a method that optimizes favorable contacts between transmembrane helical bundles. The model is shown to be stable in a membrane environment, and is able to account for a number of properties of the protein reported in previous experimental studies.\n",
            "Abstract A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus, was discovered in 2002 and caused a fatal disease in 2003. The virus has been shown to induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies, but detailed information concerning conformational neutralizing epitopes and critical amino acids is limited. The present work describes the discovery of a new conformational epitope in the receptor binding domain located outside the receptor binding motif region, which is located between aa. 318 510 and has been proven to be a major determinant determinant in inducing neutralizing antibody development. The epitope consists of several discontinuous peptides and spatially located near the receptor binding motif region of the IV. In order to further confirm this notion, two methods were selected to evaluate neutralizing activity. The experiments revealed that the monoclonal antibodies could block the infection of pseudotype virus into target IV6 cells through interference with protein and I2 interaction. In addition, the chimeric antibody retained high affinity and significant neutralizing activity as compared to the original murine monoclonal antibody. The results indicate that the receptor binding domain of IV plays a crucial role in the process of viral infection and host immune response, especially as a dominant antigen in inducing neutralizing antibody development.\n",

            "Abstract The antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against many enveloped viruses, including dengue virus, influenza and hepatitis virus, is believed to be mediated by inducing misfolding of viral linked glycoproteins through inhibition of host endoplasmic reticulum resident glucosidase enzymes. The antiviral activity of glucosemimetic iminosugars that inhibit endoplasmic reticulum resident glucosidases, but not glycolipid processing, demonstrates that inhibition of glucosidases is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against dengue virus. The monograph will review the investigations of many researchers into the mechanisms of action of iminosugars and the contribution of our current understanding of these mechanisms for optimising clinical delivery of iminosugars.\n",

            "Abstract The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was a catalyst that focused world attention on the threat of emerging infectious diseases. The point the outbreak becomes a domestic affair, the burden of control falls to the pandemic preparedness and response infrastructure and institutions established by the country. The international community is not insensate to this threat having initiated numerous efforts to develop protocols and guidelines aimed at facilitating communication and cooperation across countries. In the wake of the 2003 outbreak, the international community responded to obvious weaknesses in existing health regulations that include new guidelines on information sharing, numerous global meetings, and greater institutionalization of international pandemic response mechanisms. However such developments are encouraging, as has become increasingly clear, international cooperation cannot alone effectively block the spread of emerging infectious diseases. The inevitable arrival of an outbreak within the borders of a country requires that states prepare domestic plans to manage these outbreaks. The point the outbreak becomes a domestic affair, the burden of control falls to the pandemic preparedness and response infrastructure and institutions established by the country. In this article, we present a case study of a collaborative, whole of society pandemic preparedness and response model.

            "Abstract The syncytin proteins from human and murine endogenous retroviruses were found in mouse genome and proved to be also functional in mouse placental morphogenesis. The enveloped viral infection is normally mediated by the viral envelope protein, which gives a rational explanation on how the virus enters its host during the fusion step. The fish endogenous retrovirus, syncytin 1, is the only intact fish endogenous retrovirus identified in zebrafish, which is present in lots of tissues, including the brain, fin regenerates, heart, kidney, olfactory rosettes, and retina. This results show that syncytin 1, frozen about 60e100 million years ago, still adopts a similar mechanism with other viruses that use type I envelope proteins when it enters the host cell suggesting a uniform viral entry structural conformation process during the long term evolution.\n",
            "Abstract The macrophage is an important component of the innate immune system and is involved in the activation of specific adaptive immune responses acting as antigen presenting cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the macrophage in promoting resistance to avian coronavirus infection in the context of disease resistance and susceptibility. In vitro stimulation of cultured macrophages with nitric oxide, a potent activator of macrophages, was used to determine differences in the kinetics of macrophage activation between haplotype 2 and haplotype 19 chicken lines. The rate of differentiation of macrophages derived from the more resistant chicken line was dramatically greater than that of macrophages from the more susceptible haplotype chicken line. In addition, macrophages from the more resistant chicken line differentiated more readily than macrophages from the more susceptible haplotype chicken line. In conclusion, the potential for using macrophage function to screen for resistance could be valuable in the context of disease resistance and susceptibility.\n",

            "Abstract The aim of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline enteric coronavirus in cats from a multi cat environment and a single household cat with outdoor access. The clinical history, symptoms, hematological and biochemical parameters, diagnostic tests, radiology and tissue biopsy results were obtained from cats with fever, dullness, weight loss, ascites, abdominal distension, diarrhea, pleural effusion, postsurgical complications and low ratio. The prevalence of both viruses was determined and the relationship between seroprevalence and demographic, habitat and serological variables was investigated using a logistic regression analysis. The seroprevalence of both viruses varied significantly by year, age, examination year and habitat. The seroprevalence of both viruses was significantly higher in cats cohabitating with other cats than in cats living at home. The seroprevalence of both viruses was significantly higher in stray cats than in household cats. The present study indicates that feline infectious peritonitis virus infection in cats from a multi cat environment and a single household cat with outdoor access is high and possibly increasing. The actions are necessary in multi cat environments and single household cats with outdoor access.\n",
